# legacy

This directory holds the current Ruby implementation of Spinel.

- `spinel_analyze.rb`: self-hosted analyzer
- `spinel_codegen.rb`: self-hosted code generator
- `compiler_helpers.rb`: shared Ruby helpers for the compiler passes
- `node_table_loader.rb`: AST loader used by the Ruby backend

The active compiler migration work should happen in `src/`.

This tree is a regression oracle only. `make legacy` / `make bootstrap`
build it entirely under `build/legacy/` (binaries + bootstrap
intermediates); nothing here is installed. Drive it with the
`../spinel-legacy` script. The normal C build never touches this
directory.
